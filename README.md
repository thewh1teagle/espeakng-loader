## Usage

```python
from espeakng_loader import get_library_path, load_library, make_library_available

## Usage with [phonemizer](https://github.com/bootphon/phonemizer)

Note: please use `phonemizer-fork` instead of `phonemizer` package until [#191](https://github.com/bootphon/phonemizer/pull/191) merged.

```python
from phonemizer.backend.espeak.wrapper import EspeakWrapper
from phonemizer import phonemize
import espeakng_loader

EspeakWrapper.set_library(espeakng_loader.get_library_path())
EspeakWrapper.set_data_path(espeakng_loader.get_data_path())

phonemes = phonemize('Hello')
print('Phonemes: ', phonemes)
```
